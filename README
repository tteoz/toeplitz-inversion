TOEPLITZ TRIANGULAR MATRIX INVERSION

This was for the project of Parallel Calculus (September 2015) course.
The problem we solved is the inversion of a particular type of matrices called
Toeplitz Triangular Matrix. This matrix permits to be inverted with a
sequence of DFT operations.
We designed the code to run on an IBM parallel machine, using MPI as the model for
nodes communication and the famous FFTW Fourier transform library for DFT operations.
We needed to touch some Makefiles of the FFTW tarball in order to build the library
on AIX-6.1 operating system, this is why we keep a patched version inside this
package. (I'm sorry to not provide a proper patch for FFTW porting)
This package has been tested only on AIX-6.1 Power7 system.



DIRECTORY CONTENT DESCRIPTION

fftw-build/               keeps compiled version of fftw-3.3.4

fftw-3.3.4-patched        patched version of fftw for aix power7a dei. It
                          differs from the original package because we have
                          edited some Makefiles in order to compile without errors

script/                   files to automate processs of filtering outputs,
